    "4. Does number of parking spaces have any correlation to housing price?\n",

    "6. Can we predict housing price based on area and bedroom size?\n",

    "8. Do we see a relationship between stories and number of stories in a house?\n",
    "9. Does the total number of rooms (bathroom, bedroom, guestroom, basement) increase home price more than total area?\n",
